# Check the issues page
All requirements for stage3 have been added to the issues. If we complete all of the issues we will get 40/40. If I have missed anything please feel free to add an issue. I have created the labels `documentation` and `code` to separate the two kinds of issues we will face on this stage.

# cs361 Project 2
This is the code you will use as a starting point for Project 2.  The code you have been given has the back end for a [battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game. All instructions for this assignment are available on Canvas.

# Tips and tricks:

To implement this code, you will be using [Java Spark](http://sparkjava.com).

You will make your life MUCH easier if you use [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) to seralize/deserialize the JSON objects to/from java objects.

You might also find the jquery documentation useful.
